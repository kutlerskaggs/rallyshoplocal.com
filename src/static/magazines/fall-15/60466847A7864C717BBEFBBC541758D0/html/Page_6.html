Te only problem is <br />your friends and family might <br />not know each other. We all have <br />different friend groups, and gath- <br />ering them all at one table might <br />be more challenging than we <br />think. All your guests have their <br />idiosyncrasies, and who they sit <br />next to could be tricky. </div></div><br />STEP 1: Who is coming? <br />Start by noting each guest’s per- <br />sonality traits. </div></div><br />STEP 2: Where do they sit? <br />So, you’ve worked out who will <br />click and who will clash, but <br />how do you put all the pieces or <br />people together? </div></div><br />photo by raymond craig <br />table by Amy Harris </div></div><br />DINNER <br />Guest </div></div><br />GUIDE TO SEATING <br />according to personalities </div></div><br />LOCATION & </div></div><br />EVENT SPACE <br />THE HAVEN </div></div><br />1660 E YELLOWSTONE HWY <br />CLICK HERE TO TO VISIT <br />HAVENSTUDIO.COM </div></div><br />I am not sure if there is a right <br />answer, but here is an example of <br />a prety solid game plan. </div></div><br />THE HOST <br />You are the evening’s conductor, <br />therefore, you have to sit close <br />enough to the kitchen because <br />let’s face it, you will be working it. <br />But you also have to avoid those <br />needy of your atention. </div></div><br />Now, as far as who you sit next <br />to...six next to: the Introvert, the </div></div><br />Diva, and the Activist. Te Diva <br />will help break the awkward <br />silence and the Introvert will <br />be happy to let them dominate. <br />You can keep a close eye on the <br />controversial conversation of the <br />Activist. <br />Avoid: A cohost. You want to <br />avoid “work side talk,” like when <br />should we bring out dessert?, <br />or Red or White? Do you think <br />everyone is enjoying themselves? <br />Wait to debrief at the end of the <br />party. </div></div><br />THE CHARMER <br />Te Charmer could make delight- <br />ful conversation with their own <br />reflection. Tey are your “wild <br />card” because they can sit next to <br />anyone!!! <br />Seat them last. </div></div><br />THE INTROVERT <br />Being introverted and being in a </div><br />room of new people can almost <br />shut them down, make them <br />run for the door. Teir comfort <br />because crucial to the length <br />of time in which they stay. Sit <br />them next to the Charmer, or the <br />Entertainer can work well since <br />the Introvert is too shy to ask <br />questions. <br />Aviod the Activist. Te rant can <br />go on and on. <br />Seat next to: the Host, the <br />Charmer, or the Entertainer <br />Avoid: Activist </div></div><br />THE DIVA <br />Te Diva will make connection <br />with anyone just to hear them- <br />selves talk. Seat the Diva next to <br />the Introvert because they tend to <br />be great listeners, and the Charm- <br />er will validate how great the Diva <br />is. By the end of dinner, they will <br />be their number one fan. <br />Avoid: the Entertainer. <br />Tey are competition. </div></div><br />THEACTIVIST <br />Tere is nothing wrong with hav- <br />ing a cause, but time and place is <br />an underrated concept. No topic <br />can be too controversial to them. <br />Tey will defend their postion <br />as smartest person in the room. <br />Tey will die on the hill. <br />Seat the Activist next to the Diva <br />or Entertainer. Tey will defuse <br />the flame by puting the aten- <br />tion back on themselves. Another <br />good option is the Host. <br />Teachers keep their trouble mak- <br />ers close to keep them in check <br />for a reason. <br />Avoid: the Introvert, because <br />they could get on a tangent and <br />ruin dessert. </div></div><br />THE ENTERTAINER <br />Te Entertainer commands a <br />room, but making sure they are <br />not overbearing can be tricky. <br />Pair him with the Introvert who <br />will let the Entertainer take <br />center stage. <br />Avoid the Diva and the Host. <br />Te Diva will get jealous and <br />the Host has to slide in and out, <br />acting interested in every story <br />can result in a burned dessert or <br />empty wine glass. </div></body></html>
