Color can do so much more <br />than we think. It makes you look younger, can <br />bring out our eyes and compliment your skin <br />tone. </div></div><br />Tis fall season the BRONDE OMBRE remains <br />one of the hotest hair color trends, maybe <br />because it is ridiculously low maintenance. Te <br />variety of this trend can be seen in every magazine, <br />hair blogs and on nearly every runway. Go bold, <br />so≈øt, or natural with endless color choices. </div></div><br />SHAYLEE AT </div></div><br />ALLURE BEAUTY <br />HAIR, MAKE UP, <br />NAILS & MORE <br />1632 E 2ND ST </div></div><br />330.206.9852 <br />CLICK HERE TO FOLLOW <br />ON FACEBOOK </div></body></html>
