Man, I <br />did my makeup on <br />point today or maybe <br />you're thinking should <br />I put more on? Maybe <br />you're even thinking <br />that makeup makes <br />you look like a whole <br />different person. <br />Whatever you are <br />thinking is great for the <br />moment, but think of <br />this next time you are <br />applying makeup with <br />a brush or sponge. <br />How many times have <br />I cleaned this brush? <br />How many germs <br />have contaminated <br />this makeup? What </div></div><br />YOU NEED: </div></div><br />BASIC DISH SOAP (TO <br />DISINFECT AND CLEAN) </div></div><br />EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL (TO <br />RECONDITION THE BRISTLE <br />HAIR AFTER IT’S STRIPPED <br />OF OILS AND DISINFECTED BY <br />THE SOAP) </div></div><br />DINNER PLATE OR BOWL <br />A HANGER </div></div><br />CHIP CLIPS/CLOTHES PINS/ <br />HAIR TIES/RUBBER BANDS </div><br />bacteria is growing in <br />my makeup brushes, <br />makeup and on my <br />face? <br />If it isn’t already, <br />washing your makeup <br />brushes should be <br />a permanent part of <br />your beauty routine. <br />Cleaning is so im- <br />portant for the quality <br />and life of both your <br />brushes and your skin. <br />Tink about it – there <br />is so much makeup, <br />oil, bacteria, and dirt <br />trapped in an unclean <br />brush, and unless you <br />wash them, you’re <br />rubbing it all back <br />into your skin…um, <br />gross. Makeup brushes <br />should be cleaned aſter <br />every use: foundation </div></div><br />Steps: </div></div><br />1. Pour the dish soap onto the <br />plate – you don’t need too much. <br />2. Add a little bit of extra virgin <br />olive oil (evoo). The ratio should <br />be approximately 2 parts dish <br />soap to 1 1/2 parts evoo and <br />should look something like this: <br />3. Take your first brush and stir <br />it up in the Mixture in a circular <br />motion (you should see some of <br />the makeup start to come off in <br />the mixture). Don’t push down <br />hard or you’ll ruin the bristles. </div><br />brushes-daily or aſter <br />each use – liquids will <br />trap more bacteria than <br />powder and need to be <br />cleaned more frequent- <br />ly, powder/eyeshadow <br />brushes-aſter each new <br />color applied, eyeliner <br />brushes-daily because <br />anything going into <br />your eye or by your <br />eye needs to be clean <br />to prevent infections. <br />Makeup cleaner sprays <br />can be expensive for <br />how oſten you should <br />be using them. My fa- <br />vorite makeup cleaner <br />can be found in most <br />kitchens. </div><br />4. Then wipe the brush back <br />and forth on your hand or paper <br />towel to release the makeup from <br />the brush. This removes all the <br />pigments and kills the bacteria. <br />(DO NOT PUSH DOWN TOO <br />HARD OR YOU CAN DAMAGE <br />THE BRISTLES). <br />5. Then swirl your brush under <br />WARM water into the palm of <br />your hand to throughly clean it <br />off. Do this until brush is clean- <br />until the water runs clear of the <br />pigments, oil and soap. (NOTE: <br />DO NOT use hot water, the high <br />temperature will damage your <br />brushes). Then squeeze brushes <br />lightly to get excess water out of <br />brushes. </div></div><br />6. Lay brush flat on a paper <br />towel. </div></div><br />7. Once they are all rinsed clean, <br />gently wipe the brush dry with <br />a paper towel and blot out the <br />excess water. (Regular paper <br />towels work best because they <br />will not leave lint on the brushes) </div></div><br />**Repeat steps 3-6 with the remainder of <br />your brushes. </div></body></html>
