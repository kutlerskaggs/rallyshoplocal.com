Einstein and others of his <br />cognitive capacity place the same reverence <br />on an individual’s ability to imagine the <br />various possibilities and realities embedded <br />in all humanity. Imagination is the catalyst. <br />All great endeavors, inventions, cures, <br />and progressive thought all start within an <br />active imagination. Te surest way to stifle <br />growth and humanity is to strip away the <br />ability (or opportunity) to be imaginative. <br />Tis phenomena has found its zenith (at <br />least perceivably) in the early years of the <br />21st Century. Tat which has made people <br />great has been pilfered and replaced with <br />sanctioned complacency and glorified <br />apathy. So, who is to blame? Te youth <br />themselves? Hardly. Tey are no more to <br />blame than the target is for being bullied; <br />or the child for growing up abused. Our <br />children are products of their environment. <br />If the environment we create for them <br />allows and encourages a ‘throw away’ <br />culture, then there is no surprise that their </div><br />(and our) behavior embodies that mantra. <br />Tis being the case, the environment we <br />create supports and promotes the antithesis <br />that will be reflected through our youth. <br />When the products that we take pride in are <br />deemed obsolete the day aſter you procure <br />them (cell phones, computers, cars, etc.), <br />then why would one not discard it for a <br />beter option. </div></div><br />What if the best option is one that promotes <br />cognitive growth, brings the family of all <br />ages together, encourages imagination, <br />atention to the environment, and brings <br />awareness to alternative entities? Oh, and <br />is the epitome of refurbished/re-usability? <br />Tis is as simple as building a Fairy house. <br />Te absolute, most important aspect an <br />adult can give to a child, or another adult, <br />is time together. Many families spend time <br />together engaging in less than stimulating <br />activities. Why not take that same amount <br />of time and apply it to an artful expression <br />of love and understanding. Stacey Kaiser, <br />the owner of Blackberry Mountain Giſt <br />Shoppe emphasizes, “We are never too <br />old for fairytales.” Quite frankly, when you <br />engage in an act of love (not to be confused </div><br />with lust, see where those operating under <br />that mentality have goten) nothing is ever <br />obsolete. Te creativity intertwined with <br />the craſtmanship begs the question “why <br />are not more people taking this up as ‘THE’ <br />family past time?” I would go so far as to <br />claim that this endeavor would never be <br />simply a way to pass time, but the ultimate <br />in time creation. </div></div><br />When people follow their hearts and create <br />with a childlike exuberance, even the most <br />laborious tasks become caveats for passion. <br />Te beauty of these fairy palaces is beyond <br />compare. Teir designs seem to originate <br />from another dimension; one so glorious <br />that its replication dares the imagination to <br />fill in the gaps. Blackberry Mountain Giſt <br />Shoppe just might be that window or portal <br />to that graceful, harmonious land where the <br />imagination runs wild with possibility. If <br />you can think it, you can build it; if you can <br />build it, you can apply it. And when we apply <br />the concepts inherent in the development of <br />a fairy land to our world, what a world we <br />can create. Tis in mind, “we are never too <br />old for fairy tales;” they may actually save us <br />and our world. </div><br />Photographer | Raymond Craig </div></body></html>
