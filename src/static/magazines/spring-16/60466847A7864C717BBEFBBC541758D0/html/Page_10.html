Additionally, the term has had equally <br />numerous validations depending on the point <br />of origin or context. Tere are, however, few <br />notable manifestations of ‘art’ that could be <br />unanimously agreed upon even by the lay <br />individual. Some examples would be … Starry <br />Night, Les Miserable, Stairway to Heaven, Te <br />Sistine Chapel, Te Kiss, anything DaVinci, <br />a woman’s figure, the Bolshoi, Lauryn Hill’s <br />prose, Banksy’s brilliance, all expressions <br />stemming from an unending reservoir of love <br />for what the artists are engaged in.

All that ever comes <br />from that mentality is masochistic chaffing of <br />anything one puts his hands on, thus destroy- <br />ing the very foundation of ‘art’, negating the </div></div><br />‘appealing’ component. Tank heavens there <br />are those that have the capacity and <br />rational thought to expose the populace to <br />what once was, and could be again, the artistry <br />of living life. Being a mammal, I grow hair, a <br />lot of it, and need to tend to it or run the risk of <br />coming off as Captain Caveman. </div></div><br />“The Diego Rivera and <br />Frida Kahlo of <br />grooming, <br />own this oasis <br />of class and style,” </div></div><br />Dan and Jennifer, of Citizen Shave, are artisans <br />and have the capacity to deal with the endeav- <br />or that is my body hair. Te Diego Rivera and <br />Frida Kahlo of grooming, own this oasis of <br />class and style, carrying arsenals ranging from <br />the antique to the contemporary debonair. <br />Te knowledge, skill, and manner in which <br />they operate are reminiscent of any artist man- <br />ifesting greatness.
