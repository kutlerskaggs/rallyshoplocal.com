Te Westcot lights <br />provide a lot of control, leting <br />me direct the focus and quality <br />of light. In this case, we wanted <br />to mimic the photos and pastel <br />paintings from that era where <br />the models have nice highlights <br />in the hair and clothing, but the <br />face is soſt and diffused. I was <br />able to accomplish this with <br />three lights, where the third <br />light is cleaning up the shad- <br />ows in the backdrop, as well as <br />bouncing off to give separation <br />for the model. While I would <br />normally use a full sized DSLR <br />for these shoots, we decided to </div></div><br />test out Canon’s new Powershot <br />G3X to see how well it could <br />perform in this situation. While <br />this camera has a fixed lens, the <br />zoom range is a full 24-600. Te <br />large sensor and 20 megapixels <br />also performed well, making it <br />quite easy to extract the mod- <br />el in post and get the image I <br />was looking for. I would defi- <br />nitely recommend this as an <br />all-purpose walk around cam- <br />era, especially in wildlife where <br />you need to get close but don’t <br />want to lug around a bunch of <br />huge lense <br />that not only doe <br />Camera Outfit <br />the equipme <br />this shoot <br />in the bas <br />backdrops ide <br />shoot. </div></div><br />CAMERA EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BY <br />WYOMING CAMERA OUTFITTERS <br />LOCATED AT 128 W 2ND ST </div></div><br />CLICK HERE TO TO VISIT <br />WYOMINGCAMERAOUTFITTERS.COM </div></div><br />HAIR PILAR SOLEDAD <br />MAKE UP ALYSSA NAVARRO <br />MODEL SAIRIE FAYCE </div></div><br />CANON POWERSHOT G3X <br />(USED FOR MODEL SHOT) </div><br />CANON POWERSHOT <br />G7X </div></div><br />( USED FOR BEHIND <br />THE SCENES SHOT) </div></div><br />Behind the <br />scenes </div></div><br />lighting </div></div><br />WESTCOTT 5 DAYLIGHT <br />SOFTBOX KIT </div></div><br />WESTCOTT SPIDERLITE TD6 <br />STRIPBANK KIT </div><br />F </div><br />r </div><br />o </div><br />t </div><br />e </div><br />d </div></body></html>
