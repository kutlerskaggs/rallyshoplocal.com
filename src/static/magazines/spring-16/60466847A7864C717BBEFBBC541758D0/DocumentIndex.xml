is a way to show your friends and
family that you love and apperciate
them. Te only problem is
your friends and family might
not know each other. We all have
different friend groups, and gathering
them all at one table might
be more challenging than we
think. All your guests have their
idiosyncrasies, and who they sit
next to could be tricky.
STEP 1: Who is coming?
Start by noting each guest’s personality
traits.
STEP 2: Where do they sit?
So, you’ve worked out who will
click and who will clash, but
how do you put all the pieces or
people together?

I am not sure if there is a right
answer, but here is an example of
a prety solid game plan.
THE HOST
You are the evening’s conductor,
therefore, you have to sit close
enough to the kitchen because
let’s face it, you will be working it.
But you also have to avoid those
needy of your atention.
Now, as far as who you sit next
to...six next to: the Introvert, the
Diva, and the Activist. Te Diva
will help break the awkward
silence and the Introvert will
be happy to let them dominate.
You can keep a close eye on the
controversial conversation of the
Activist.
Avoid: A cohost. You want to
avoid “work side talk,” like when
should we bring out dessert?,
or Red or White? Do you think
everyone is enjoying themselves?
Wait to debrief at the end of the
party.
THE CHARMER
Te Charmer could make delightful
conversation with their own
reflection. Tey are your “wild
card” because they can sit next to
anyone!!!
Seat them last.
THE INTROVERT
Being introverted and being in a
room of new people can almost
shut them down, make them
run for the door. Teir comfort
because crucial to the length
of time in which they stay. Sit
them next to the Charmer, or the
Entertainer can work well since
the Introvert is too shy to ask
questions.
Aviod the Activist. Te rant can
go on and on.
Seat next to: the Host, the
Charmer, or the Entertainer
Avoid: Activist
THE DIVA
Te Diva will make connection
with anyone just to hear themselves
talk. Seat the Diva next to
the Introvert because they tend to
be great listeners, and the Charmer
will validate how great the Diva
is. By the end of dinner, they will
be their number one fan.
Avoid: the Entertainer.
Tey are competition.
THEACTIVIST
Tere is nothing wrong with having
a cause, but time and place is
an underrated concept. No topic
can be too controversial to them.
Tey will defend their postion
as smartest person in the room.
Tey will die on the hill.
Seat the Activist next to the Diva
or Entertainer. Tey will defuse
the flame by puting the atention
back on themselves. Another
good option is the Host.
Teachers keep their trouble makers
close to keep them in check
for a reason.
Avoid: the Introvert, because
they could get on a tangent and
ruin dessert.
THE ENTERTAINER
Te Entertainer commands a
room, but making sure they are
not overbearing can be tricky.
Pair him with the Introvert who
will let the Entertainer take
center stage.
Avoid the Diva and the Host.
Te Diva will get jealous and
the Host has to slide in and out,
acting interested in every story
can result in a burned dessert or
empty wine glass.</page>
  <page p="7" label="7">Host
Introvert
Diva
Activist
Entertainer
Charmer
The Host strategically sits
next to the Introvert to bring
them comfort, knowing the
Diva and the Entertainer
will will be competing for
their attention. This will
make it easy to slide in and
out. The host chooses to
sit across from the Activist
to at least have them in
sensory distance to keep the
conversation going.
Sitting the Charmer inbetween the Diva and
the Entertainer will defuse the Entertainer
and the Diva from the one upping each other
by acting intrigued. The Entertainer will be
so set on winning the coolest guy in the room
award, he will not engage in controversial
conversations with the Activist.</page>

The
THE TERM ‘ART’ DEFINED as,
“the quality, production, expression,
or realm, according to aesthetic
principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or
of more than ordinary significance” (www.
dictionaryreference.com), has been applied
to numerous entities, both imagined and
realized. Additionally, the term has had equally
numerous validations depending on the point
of origin or context. Tere are, however, few
notable manifestations of ‘art’ that could be
unanimously agreed upon even by the lay
individual. Some examples would be … Starry
Night, Les Miserable, Stairway to Heaven, Te
Sistine Chapel, Te Kiss, anything DaVinci,
a woman’s figure, the Bolshoi, Lauryn Hill’s
prose, Banksy’s brilliance, all expressions
stemming from an unending reservoir of love
for what the artists are engaged in. At that
point, the audience is in the presence of more
than mere greatness.
For men, the avenues for artistic expression
have been dead ends, save for anything involving
brute strength, not that being strong is
wrong, but why be a brute. All that ever comes
from that mentality is masochistic chaffing of
anything one puts his hands on, thus destroying
the very foundation of ‘art’, negating the
‘appealing’ component. Tank heavens there
are those that have the capacity and
rational thought to expose the populace to
what once was, and could be again, the artistry
of living life. Being a mammal, I grow hair, a
lot of it, and need to tend to it or run the risk of
coming off as Captain Caveman.
“The Diego Rivera and
Frida Kahlo of
grooming,
own this oasis
of class and style,”
Dan and Jennifer, of Citizen Shave, are artisans
and have the capacity to deal with the endeavor
that is my body hair. Te Diego Rivera and
Frida Kahlo of grooming, own this oasis of
class and style, carrying arsenals ranging from
the antique to the contemporary debonair.

APPROACH THE START of the
new season with a sense of confidence.
A new hair color can bring out your
inner fab, fierce self. Color can do so much more
than we think. It makes you look younger, can
bring out our eyes and compliment your skin
tone.
Tis fall season the BRONDE OMBRE remains
one of the hotest hair color trends, maybe
because it is ridiculously low maintenance. Te
variety of this trend can be seen in every magazine,
hair blogs and on nearly every runway. Go bold,

WHILE
PUTTING
MAKEUP on
your face what do you
think about? Man, I
did my makeup on
point today or maybe
you're thinking should
I put more on? Maybe
you're even thinking
that makeup makes
you look like a whole
different person.
Whatever you are
thinking is great for the
moment, but think of
this next time you are
applying makeup with
a brush or sponge.
How many times have
I cleaned this brush?
How many germs
have contaminated
this makeup? What
YOU NEED:
BASIC DISH SOAP (TO
DISINFECT AND CLEAN)
EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL (TO
RECONDITION THE BRISTLE
HAIR AFTER IT’S STRIPPED
OF OILS AND DISINFECTED BY
THE SOAP)

bacteria is growing in
my makeup brushes,
makeup and on my
face?
If it isn’t already,
washing your makeup
brushes should be
a permanent part of
your beauty routine.
Cleaning is so important
for the quality
and life of both your
brushes and your skin.
Tink about it – there
is so much makeup,
oil, bacteria, and dirt
trapped in an unclean
brush, and unless you
wash them, you’re
rubbing it all back
into your skin…um,
gross. Makeup brushes
should be cleaned aſter
every use: foundation
Steps:
1. Pour the dish soap onto the
plate – you don’t need too much.
2. Add a little bit of extra virgin
olive oil (evoo). The ratio should
be approximately 2 parts dish
soap to 1 1/2 parts evoo and
should look something like this:
3. Take your first brush and stir
it up in the Mixture in a circular
motion (you should see some of
the makeup start to come off in
the mixture). Don’t push down
hard or you’ll ruin the bristles.
brushes-daily or aſter
each use – liquids will
trap more bacteria than
powder and need to be
cleaned more frequently,
powder/eyeshadow
brushes-aſter each new
color applied, eyeliner
brushes-daily because
anything going into
your eye or by your
eye needs to be clean
to prevent infections.
Makeup cleaner sprays
can be expensive for
how oſten you should
be using them. My favorite
makeup cleaner
can be found in most
kitchens.
4. Then wipe the brush back
and forth on your hand or paper
towel to release the makeup from
the brush. This removes all the
pigments and kills the bacteria.
(DO NOT PUSH DOWN TOO
HARD OR YOU CAN DAMAGE
THE BRISTLES).
5. Then swirl your brush under
WARM water into the palm of
your hand to throughly clean it
off. Do this until brush is cleanuntil
the water runs clear of the
pigments, oil and soap. (NOTE:
DO NOT use hot water, the high
temperature will damage your
brushes). Then squeeze brushes
lightly to get excess water out of
brushes.
6. Lay brush flat on a paper
towel.
7. Once they are all rinsed clean,
gently wipe the brush dry with
a paper towel and blot out the
excess water. (Regular paper
towels work best because they
will not leave lint on the brushes)
**Repeat steps 3-6 with the remainder of
your brushes.</page>

MOST WOMEN would choose mascara
if they could only use one makeup product.
Long luscious lashes are the envy of most
women. What if you could wash your face,
apply lipgloss, and go without fussing with
mascara or other products. Eyelash extensions
are the answer. I recently got them aſter
years of being met with, “Lash extensions.
You must try them,” when complimenting
a friend’s flutery fringe.
Te thought of
eyelash extensions individually applied to a
single eyelash seemed a litle extreme, but it
resulted in a gorgeous, natural appearance.

THERAPY
BEAUTY IS NOT SKIN DEEP. When we
relax, we can radiate good energy. Massage has
many heath benefits. Here are only 2 of them:
If you suffer from sore muscles, massage therapy
can help increase and improve circulation, in
much the same way rubbing your elbow when
you knock it on a table helps to relieve the pain.
According to 2011 study published in the Annals of
InternalMedicine
It improves sleep. “Massage promotes relaxation
and sleep in those undergoing chemo or
radiation therapy,” says Lisa Marie de Miranda,
registered massage therapist and kinesiologist
at Paleolife Massage Terapy.</page>

WHAT DOES IT MEAN to dress age

be able to dress how we want. “Dress for the
occasion” is always what my mother would
tell me.

TRENDY
Tere are not a lot of options for women in
your late 20’s-40’s. We have the option to dress
young or really old. Tere is no inbetween. I
tend to lean more on the trendy side, but who
can afford to change your wardrobe every
season as we did when we were kids with no
real financial responsibility.
We see trends go in and out and eventually
everything cycles around. My approach
to following trends, without replacing my
closet, is to buy classic pieces and add trendy
accessories and layers.</page>

photo and tutorial by RAYMOND CRAIG
For the pinup series
lighting was very important,
both for extracting the model
from the background, as well as
to create the clean look from the
classic advertisements from the
50s and 60s. Te Westcot lights
provide a lot of control, leting
me direct the focus and quality
of light. In this case, we wanted
to mimic the photos and pastel
paintings from that era where
the models have nice highlights
in the hair and clothing, but the
face is soſt and diffused. I was
able to accomplish this with
three lights, where the third
light is cleaning up the shadows
in the backdrop, as well as
bouncing off to give separation
for the model. While I would
normally use a full sized DSLR
for these shoots, we decided to
test out Canon’s new Powershot
G3X to see how well it could
perform in this situation. While
this camera has a fixed lens, the
zoom range is a full 24-600. Te
large sensor and 20 megapixels
also performed well, making it
quite easy to extract the model
in post and get the image I
was looking for. I would definitely
recommend this as an
all-purpose walk around camera,
especially in wildlife where
you need to get close but don’t
want to lug around a bunch of

  <page p="59" label="59">If you want your children to be intelligent, read
them fairytales. - Albert Einstein Arguably the
brightest mind in multiple generations
proclaimed this statement, and it holds
true to this day. Einstein and others of his
cognitive capacity place the same reverence
on an individual’s ability to imagine the
various possibilities and realities embedded
in all humanity. Imagination is the catalyst.
All great endeavors, inventions, cures,
and progressive thought all start within an
active imagination. Te surest way to stifle
growth and humanity is to strip away the
ability (or opportunity) to be imaginative.
Tis phenomena has found its zenith (at
least perceivably) in the early years of the
21st Century. Tat which has made people
great has been pilfered and replaced with
sanctioned complacency and glorified
apathy. So, who is to blame? Te youth
themselves? Hardly. Tey are no more to
blame than the target is for being bullied;
or the child for growing up abused. Our
children are products of their environment.
If the environment we create for them
allows and encourages a ‘throw away’
culture, then there is no surprise that their
(and our) behavior embodies that mantra.
Tis being the case, the environment we
create supports and promotes the antithesis
that will be reflected through our youth.
When the products that we take pride in are
deemed obsolete the day aſter you procure
them (cell phones, computers, cars, etc.),
then why would one not discard it for a
beter option.
What if the best option is one that promotes
cognitive growth, brings the family of all
ages together, encourages imagination,
atention to the environment, and brings
awareness to alternative entities? Oh, and
is the epitome of refurbished/re-usability?
Tis is as simple as building a Fairy house.
Te absolute, most important aspect an
adult can give to a child, or another adult,
is time together. Many families spend time
together engaging in less than stimulating
activities. Why not take that same amount
of time and apply it to an artful expression
of love and understanding. Stacey Kaiser,
the owner of Blackberry Mountain Giſt
Shoppe emphasizes, “We are never too
old for fairytales.” Quite frankly, when you
engage in an act of love (not to be confused
with lust, see where those operating under
that mentality have goten) nothing is ever
obsolete. Te creativity intertwined with
the craſtmanship begs the question “why
are not more people taking this up as ‘THE’
family past time?” I would go so far as to
claim that this endeavor would never be
simply a way to pass time, but the ultimate
in time creation.
When people follow their hearts and create
with a childlike exuberance, even the most
laborious tasks become caveats for passion.
Te beauty of these fairy palaces is beyond
compare. Teir designs seem to originate
from another dimension; one so glorious
that its replication dares the imagination to
fill in the gaps. Blackberry Mountain Giſt
Shoppe just might be that window or portal
to that graceful, harmonious land where the
imagination runs wild with possibility. If
you can think it, you can build it; if you can
build it, you can apply it. And when we apply
the concepts inherent in the development of
a fairy land to our world, what a world we
can create. Tis in mind, “we are never too
old for fairy tales;” they may actually save us
and our world.
